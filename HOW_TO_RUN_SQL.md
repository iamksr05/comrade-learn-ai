# How to Run the SQL Schema - Simple Steps

## ✅ Yes! Copy Everything at Once

**You should copy ALL the content from `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` and paste it ONCE into Supabase SQL Editor.**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the SQL File
1. Open `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` in your project
2. Select ALL content (Cmd/Ctrl + A)
3. Copy it (Cmd/Ctrl + C)

### Step 2: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New query** button (or the "+" icon)

### Step 3: Paste and Run
1. Paste ALL the SQL code (Cmd/Ctrl + V)
2. Click the **Run** button (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
3. Wait for it to complete (should take a few seconds)

### Step 4: Verify It Worked
1. Look for "Success" message at the bottom
2. Go to **Table Editor** in the left sidebar
3. You should see two tables:
   - `user_profiles`
   - `user_courses`

## Why Copy Everything at Once?

✅ **Faster** - One operation instead of many  
✅ **Safer** - All commands run together  
✅ **Complete** - Everything is set up correctly  
✅ **Ordered** - Commands run in the right order  

## What Happens When You Run It?

The SQL will:
1. ✅ Create the `user_profiles` table
2. ✅ Create the `user_courses` table
3. ✅ Set up security policies
4. ✅ Create indexes for performance
5. ✅ Set up automatic timestamps

All in one go!

## Common Questions

### Q: Should I run it line by line?
**A:** No! Copy and paste everything at once. The file is designed to run all at once.

### Q: What if I get an error?
**A:** 
- Check that you copied everything
- Make sure you're in the SQL Editor
- Try running it again (it's safe to run multiple times)

### Q: Can I modify the SQL?
**A:** Only if you know what you're doing. For now, just run it as-is.

### Q: Do I need to run it multiple times?
**A:** No, just once. After that, the tables stay in your database.
